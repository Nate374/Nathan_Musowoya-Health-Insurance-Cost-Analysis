The project used a dataset of 15,000 records of customers' medical history in the USA. I used six machine learning techniques to predict the cost of health insurance: linear regression, lasso regression, ridge regression, elastic net regression, and XGBoost.

I found that the best model for predicting health insurance costs was linear regression with interaction of independent variables, with an R-Squared score of 0.79. This means that the model was able to explain 79% of the variation in the data.

The following factors were important predictors of health insurance costs: age, sex, weight, BMI, number of dependents, smoking status, blood pressure, diabetes, exercise habits, job profile, location, and hereditary diseases.

Overall, this report shows that data mining techniques can be used to accurately predict health insurance costs. This information could be useful for insurance companies to set premiums and for individuals to understand their own health insurance costs.
